The Capstone Pokemon project takes inspiration from whose that pokemon in the Pokemon tv series and turns it into a web app.

You start the game by clicking on the start game button.

After you press start game, you will be presented with multiple checkbox to select which generation of pokemon you want in your game.

When you finished selecting all the pokemon generations you want in your game. You can now click done.

After you click done the game starts!

You play the game by entering a letter in the input box between the Start game button and the hint button. You can submit the letter to be guessed by hitting enter or by hitting submit.

If your guess is wrong, you lose 1 attempt. If correct it'll display the letter.

In the beginning is a potion that will restore 2 attempts up to a maximum of 10. You only ever have 1 potion at one time but they regenerate ever 5 correct answers.

When you are out of attempts, your score will be calculated by how many generations of pokemon involved, how many you had correct, and if you had a potion still left.

When you hit hint you'll be given a pokedex entry for that pokemon on the first go around as well as the pokemon type. On the second hint, you'll be shown a picture of the pokemon and every 10 seconds after you'll lose an attempt until you solve it.

Good luck!
